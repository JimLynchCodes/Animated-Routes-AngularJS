# UI Router Animated Routes Project

You can try the live project here: https://jimtheman.github.io/Fun-Times-on-the-Front-End

This project demonstrated animated transitions between AngularJS routes that use UI-Router.  Notice how the "About" route does a different transition (slide up / down) from the other routes (fade in / out).
