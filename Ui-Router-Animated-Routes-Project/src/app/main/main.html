    <h2>Example of AngularJS UI-Router CSS Transitions Between Routes with Support for "Special Routes".</h2>
    <p>The links in the navbar above allow you to move between routes.
       The default transition is a one second fade in / fade out of the opacity.
       However, notice that the "About" route transitions differently. This one slides up from the bottom
       and then slides back down. This "special transition" is achieved by putting an ng-class directive on
       the ui-view and then setting the controller variable based on whether $state.current.name is the
       name of the route with the special transition.</p>
